# Work Day Schuduler

## Description

- I have been tasked to modify starter code to create a day planner application that allows the user to input events throught the standarding working day. The user must also be able to clearly see a colour coded application indicating the past, present and future parts of their day. I must include the date at the top of the page and allow the user to input save and retrieve their saved events upon refreshing the page.

## Acceptance Criteria - Checklist

<!-- - When the 'Generate Password' button is clicked a prompt appears asking the user to select a password length between 8-128 characters.

- Once the user has input an integer between 8-128 the prompts cycle through the criteria asking the user if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters in their password.

- If the user enters an integer that is not between 8-128 they will be presented with a prompt alerting them, it will return a false and the criteria prompts will not show.

- 'Else' statment in place as part of error handling if user selects a length but does not select a true option for any of the letter, symbols and number criteria.

- Dependent on the users input a password will successfully generate in accordance to the selections made by the user. -->
